# Hackathon-2018-Hubdog

# Description
This is a Hubdoc themed arcade game, built with an arcade cabinet, which we made in a span of two days for our internal company hackathon project. The game is about a hubdog attempting to fetch documents to gain points. There is a health bar that gradually decreases over time. The only way for it to increase is to fetch documents and bring it back to the home bot. It is game over once the health bar reaches zero. You must retrieve documents before our competitors and try to survive as long as you can!
