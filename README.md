# Hackathon-2018-Hubdog

# Description
Hubdoc themed arcade game, built with arcade cabinet, leaderboards and all that good stuff. Theme would be a dog sprite attempting to fetch documents, to gain points. Retrieving documents before our competitors, remapping of keys to resemble when sites change, incorporate captchas, 2Fa, all the problems we encounters on a daily basis building robots.
